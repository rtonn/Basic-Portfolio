            <p>Hi, my name is Rick Tonn. I have worked in the federal student loan industry for a little over 20 years. I was responsible for the electronic data exchange processes between colleges, universities, lenders, servicers, the department of education, and our 3rd party vendors. I was also involved in new product development & system enhancements, along with mass email and letter communications.</p>
            <p>I have a good ability to connect with people. In my last job, I was recognized for my number of customer relationships which resulted in a good reputation for our company, which ultimately increased our business.</p> 
            <p>If you have questions or would like to schedule an appointment or interview, please <u><a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact me</a></u>. </p>
